# Webapp Boilerplate

This application contains two versions of the same application: one in JavaScript and the other in TypeScript. Unless specified
below these applications should behave in the exact same way (including npm scripts). More detailed information on the repositories
can be found in readmes inside their respective directories.

Application differences:

- JS uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for testing and coverage, TS uses mocha/istanbul
- JS uses Eslint, TS uses TSlint
